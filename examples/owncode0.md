Review of `IssueTemplate` Implementation in Rust Code
=============================================================

Hello,

During a recent review of our Rust codebase, I noticed an implementation of an `IssueTemplate` struct with some associated methods. In this issue, I will provide my feedback and suggestions on how to improve this implementation.

Code Snippet:
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct IssueTemplate
{
    pub raw: String,
    title_template: String,
    body_template: String,
}

impl IssueTemplate
{
    // Load the template from the given path
    pub fn new(path: &str) -> Self
    {
        let content = fs::read_to_string(path).expect("Unable to read file");

        let mut title_template = String::new();
        let mut body_template = String::new();

        // Simple parsing logic assuming title and body are separated by "---"
        if let Some((title, body)) = content.split_once("---") {
            title_template = title.trim().to_string();
            body_template = body.trim().to_string();
        }

        Self {
            raw: content,
            title_template,
            body_template,
        }
    }

    pub fn generate_issue(
        &self,
        title_data: &str,
        body_data: &str,
    ) -> Issue
    {
        Issue {
            title: self.title_template.replace("{title}", title_data),
            body: self.body_template.replace("{body}", body_data),
        }
    }
}
```
Issue Body:
--------------------------------------------------

1. The `new` method's parsing logic assumes that the title and body are separated by "---". If this assumption is incorrect, it may result in an error or unexpected behavior. Consider adding error handling for cases when the file format doesn't match the expected structure.
2. Add documentation (doc comments) to describe the purpose of the `IssueTemplate` struct, its fields, and methods. This will help developers understand how to use this code in practice.
3. The `generate_issue` method does not validate the input data before replacing placeholders. If invalid or missing placeholders are provided, it may result in errors or unexpected behavior. Consider validating user inputs to ensure proper formatting of generated issues.
4. In the `generate_issue` method, replace the hardcoded placeholder names (`{title}` and `{body}`) with constants or an enum for better maintainability and readability.
5. The `IssueTemplate` struct contains a raw field that is not used in this implementation. Consider removing it to improve clarity and reduce potential confusion.
6. Add tests to ensure the proper behavior of the `new` and `generate_issue` methods. This will help prevent regressions during future updates."
